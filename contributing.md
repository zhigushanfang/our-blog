## Suggesting Changes

Want to make our blog content even better? First of all, thank you! This page will guide you through our contribution process, including how to submit changes and claim bounties for your contributions.

### Prerequisites

To edit our documentation, you must have a [GitHub account](https://github.com). If you already have one, make sure you are logged in. If you don't, please [create one](https://github.com/join).

### Understanding GitBook's Integration with GitHub

We use a platform called [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) to host, manage and serve our documentation. GitBook fetches files from our GitHub repository `Lightning-Bounties/our-blog`, reads them and converts them into the pages you can access on [blog.lightningbounties.com](https://blog.lightningbounties.com).

#### Repository Structure

A generic structure of documentation hosted on GitBook looks like this:

```
First page
├── A group of pages
│   ├── A page
│   ├── Another page
│   ├── One more page
│   │   ├── A nested page
│   │   └── Another nested page
```

Its mirror to GitHub has the following structure:

```
├── .gitbook/
│   └── assets/
│       └── an-image.png
├── a-group-of-pages/
│   ├── a-page.md
│   ├── another-page.md
│   ├── one-more-page/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── a-nested-page.md
│   │   └── another-nested-page.md
├── README.md
└── SUMMARY.md
```

**Key Components:**

* The `.gitbook/assets` folder manages every file used in any page
* The `SUMMARY.md` file tells GitBook the order and grouping of pages
* The `README.md` file contains the first page content users see
* Groups of pages are controlled by folders named after the group title
* Nested pages have a similar structure, but require a `README.md` file in the parent folder

### Method 1: Quick Editing via GitHub Web Interface

#### Step 1: Access the Edit Function

1. Open the page you want to edit on [blog.lightningbounties.com](https://blog.lightningbounties.com)
2. Look for an "Edit on GitHub" button above the Table of Contents on the right side
3. Click on the GitHub icon to navigate to the Markdown file

#### Step 2: Edit the File

1. Click on the pencil icon labeled "Edit this file"
2. Make your edits using [Markdown formatting](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/formatting/markdown)

#### Step 5: Create Pull Request

4. Provide clear explanation of your changes
5. Submit the pull request

### Lightning Bounties Payment System

#### The Critical `close #[issue-number]` Syntax

To earn Bitcoin bounties for your contributions, you **must** include the `close #[issue-number]` syntax in your pull request description. This connects your PR to the Lightning Bounties issue and triggers automatic payment processing.

**Important Notes:**

* The `close` keyword must be in the PR description itself, not in regular comments
* Adding this connection after merging will automatically trigger Lightning Bounty payment
* If you forget to add this initially, you can edit your merged PR description later

#### If You Forgot the Close Syntax

**Option 1: Edit Your Merged Pull Request**

1. Go to your merged PR and click into it
2. Click the "..." button at the top-right of your PR description
3. Select "Edit"
4. Add `close #[issue-number]` to your PR description
5. Click "Update Comment"

**Option 2: Ask for Help**\
If you cannot edit the PR, ask the repository owner to add the `close` syntax for you.
